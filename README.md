## Introduction

The project aims to provide a straightforward example of implementing JWT authentication in applications developed with Django and the Django Ninja framework. It covers user authentication, token generation, and verification processes, ensuring secure access to application resources.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies:
3. Migrate the database:
4. Run the development server:

## Usage

After installation, you can access the application through the development server's URL, typically `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. The API endpoints for user registration, login, and secure access will be available as defined in the project's URL configurations.

## Features

- User registration and login endpoints.
- JWT token generation and verification.
- Secure access to API endpoints with JWT authentication.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following packages:
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- Django Ninja
- PyJWT

## Configuration

Configure the project settings in `settings.py`, including database configurations, secret keys, and Django Ninja settings. Ensure the JWT authentication settings are correctly set up in `ninja_jwt/authentication.py`.
